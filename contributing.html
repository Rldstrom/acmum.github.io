          <p class="lead">How to contribute to the ACM@UM Website</p>
          <hr/>
          <h3>1. Get a GitHub account.</h3>
          <p>The ACM@UM website is proudly hosted by GitHub. The source code is located at <a href="https://github.com/acmum/acmum.github.io">https://github.com/acmum/acmum.github.io</a>. If you do not have a GitHub account already you can sign up by visiting <a href="https://github.com/join">https://github.com/join</a>.</p>

          <h3>2. Fork the ACM@UM website repository</h3>
          <p>The ACM uses the "Fork &amp; Pull" contribution method. This means that you fork the repository or make a copy in your own account where you can make the changes or additions you want to. <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests">https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests</a> is great article on using pull requests which will be useful for steps 2 and 3.</p>

          <h3>3. Send a Pull Request</h3>
          <p>After all your hard work you completed your changes or additions and want to see them on the live website. What you do is send something called a pull request. What this does is sends the maintainer of the main respositoty that someone had made a change and would like the maintainer to incorporate it. The maintainer will make sure that all the changes are valid before making them live.</p>

          <h3>Appendix</h3>
          <p>What needs to be done? Fork the repo and take a look in TODO.md</p>
          <p>But I don't know anything about writing a website? <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">http://www.codecademy.com/</a> will get you on your way.</p>
          <p>But the website uses a html5 framework I'm unfamiliar with? We use <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/index.html">Bootstrap</a> and it totally rocks! Look there for documentation and examples of what you can do.</p>  
          <p>But the above just made me more confused? Stop by Dunn Hall 147 and let us help you out!</p>

          <h3>Why contribute?</h3>
          <p>1. Because you're awesome.</p>
          <p>2. Real experience in a collaborative environment in a place where your changes are logged for all to see. That means when your future employer looks you up on GitHub they'll see not only do you have an account but you work well with others.</p>
